// were framing choices that constrained Requirements / Flows / Scope — they
// belong near the top so the reader encounters them as the doc's narrative
// spine, not as bottom-of-doc reference material. Under the agency-driven
// section contract, "Include when material" lists Key Decisions early in
// the catalog (right after Problem Frame) and the catalog item's prose
// states the placement rationale.
