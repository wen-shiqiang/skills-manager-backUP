# zoom-out

Create a grounded map of an unfamiliar code area before diving into implementation or detailed explanation.

## Decision Tree

What is the user asking for?

- "Zoom out", "go up a layer", "map the relevant modules and callers", "who calls this", or similar orientation language
  Use this skill. Produce a code context map before making recommendations.

- A specific symbol, file, route, job, table, command, event, or component is named
  Trace direct callers, direct callees, entrypoints, and boundary crossings. Use the inventory helper if its candidate map would add evidence beyond what is already known.

- A feature or subsystem is named, but no concrete entrypoint is obvious
  Find likely entrypoints first: routes, commands, jobs, public exports, UI screens, handlers, tests, migrations, and package manifests.

- The user asks "how does this work?" and wants teaching, not just orientation
  Build the map first if the area is unfamiliar, then use {{ skill:eli12 }} for the final teaching-style explanation.

- The user asks for a bug fix or implementation and the edit target is unclear
  Do a short zoom-out pass first, then switch back to normal coding mode once the relevant surface is known.

- The user only needs a text search, literal occurrence count, or filename lookup
  Use {{ skill:ripgrep }} directly instead of producing an architecture map.

- The user asks for durable repository intent or product purpose documentation
  This skill is not the right fit. It maps code topology, not human intent.

## Quick Reference

| Need | Do |
| --- | --- |
| Optional candidate inventory around a symbol or path | `python3 scripts/zoom_out_inventory.py --repo <repo> --target "<symbol-or-path>" --json` |
| Human-readable inventory | `python3 scripts/zoom_out_inventory.py --repo <repo> --target "<symbol-or-path>"` |
| Full discovery method | Read `references/discovery.md` |
| Caller and callee tracing rules | Read `references/caller-mapping.md` |
| Final answer shape | Read `references/output-contract.md` or copy `templates/zoom-out-map.md` |
| Hidden edge cases | Read `references/gotchas.md` |
| Validate the skill package | From the skill directory: `python3 scripts/validate.py .` |
| Run local packaging and probe tests | From the skill directory: `python3 scripts/test_skill.py .` |

## Default Workflow

1. Restate the target in concrete terms: symbol, path, route, feature, job, package, or subsystem.
2. Resolve the repository root and any user-provided scope boundaries. If the target is missing and cannot be inferred from context, ask one concise question.
3. Use `scripts/zoom_out_inventory.py` if candidate discovery would add useful evidence. Known paths or focused searches may suffice; helper output is a lead generator, not proof.
4. Choose searches from the evidence available: exact identifiers, filename fragments, route segments, test names, config keys, table names, queue names, event names, or API paths. Read a known target directly when that is the useful next step.
5. Identify the center of gravity: the files needed to explain who defines, orchestrates, or exposes the behavior, without a file quota.
6. Trace one layer up and one layer down:
   - Upstream: callers, routes, commands, jobs, event subscribers, tests, UI screens, public exports.
   - Downstream: services, data access, adapters, external APIs, queues, stores, feature flags, config.
7. Group files by responsibility, not by directory alone.
8. Mark observation vs inference. If a caller path is based on a textual match, say so until you verify execution wiring.
9. Return a compact map. Do not include every file found.
10. End with the smallest useful next-read list or implementation target if the user plans to edit.

## Output Contract

Use these sections when they help. Omit sections that would add noise.

- **Target** - The symbol, file, route, feature, or subsystem being mapped.
- **One-Layer Map** - A responsibility-grouped map of relevant modules.
- **Caller Paths** - How execution reaches the target from user actions, jobs, commands, tests, or public APIs.
- **Callees And Dependencies** - What the target invokes, persists to, publishes, imports, or delegates to.
- **Boundaries** - Ownership, package, process, network, persistence, or framework boundaries crossed.
- **Evidence** - File paths, symbols, search queries, and commands used.
- **Unknowns** - Dynamic dispatch, generated code, framework registration, or missing runtime evidence.
- **Next Reads** - The shortest ordered list of files to inspect next.

## Reading Guide

| Situation | Read |
| --- | --- |
| Need to find the right entrypoints before tracing | `references/discovery.md` |
| Need to decide what counts as a caller, callee, or boundary | `references/caller-mapping.md` |
| Need a consistent final map with evidence and uncertainty labels | `references/output-contract.md` |
| Results are noisy, missing, dynamic, generated, or framework-driven | `references/gotchas.md` |

## Gotchas

1. A directory tree is not an architecture map. Show responsibilities and execution paths, not just folders.
2. Textual matches are leads, not verified callers. Confirm imports, registration, routes, tests, or runtime wiring before presenting a path as real.
3. Dynamic systems hide call paths in config, decorators, dependency injection containers, generated code, queues, conventions, and framework registration.
4. The useful scope is usually one layer up and one layer down. Expanding until every dependency appears makes the map less useful.
5. Do not erase uncertainty. A precise "likely caller, not verified" is better than a confident but unsupported diagram.

## Helper Scripts

- `scripts/zoom_out_inventory.py` creates a first-pass inventory of candidate center files, caller candidates, import edges, directory clusters, manifests, and suggested reads.
- `scripts/validate.py` checks structure, frontmatter, cross-references, required directories, evals, and Python syntax.
- `scripts/test_skill.py` runs validation, eval coverage checks, cross-reference checks, and a temporary-repo probe for the inventory script.

## Verification Notes

When maintaining this package, verify command syntax with `--help` and run `scripts/test_skill.py`, which builds a temporary codebase and confirms the inventory helper returns target matches, caller candidates, import edges, and suggested reads. These are package maintenance checks, not prerequisites for each zoom-out invocation.

## When Guidance Stops Helping

When the helper or a bundled tracing assumption misses real wiring, follow repository registration and the installed framework's official docs or primary source. Keep unproven edges explicit when runtime evidence is unavailable. Propose a canonical skill correction with the missed path, source/version, and a small counterexample; do not silently edit installed copies or substitute a generic framework story for observed application behavior.
