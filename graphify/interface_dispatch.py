"""Member-level dispatch from an interface requirement to its single implementer.

A call through an injected dependency lands on the interface's method node,
because that is what the call site names: `_report.Build()` where `_report` is
an `IReport` resolves to `IReport.Build()`. The implementing method is a
separate node, and nothing joins the two, so a directed walk stops at the
interface and every chain through an injected dependency is cut at that point.

This resolver runs after all files are extracted, with the merged corpus
available, and links the interface's method to the implementing method:

    ireport_ireport_build  --dispatches_to-->  report_report_build

It only fires when the interface has exactly one implementer and that
implementer owns exactly one method of the same name, the single-owner guard
`resolve_pascal_inherited_calls` and `resolve_ruby_member_calls` already use.
Walking `implements` to the one type that can serve the call mirrors what the
runtime does; guessing among several implementers would not, so anything
ambiguous is left alone.

The join is per method rather than per call site, so one edge reconnects every
call that reaches the interface method. Confidence is `INFERRED`: the target is
forced once there is a single implementer, but the source text never names it.

The mechanism knows no language. Each language registers a thin wrapper
(`graphify.csharp_dispatch` for C# interfaces, #3003) that fixes the file
suffixes both ends of a pair must be declared in: `implements` is resolved by
name, so a same-named type from another language is a collision, not an
implementation. A language whose interfaces have the same shape (Swift
protocols, for one) adds a wrapper, not a second copy of the algorithm.
